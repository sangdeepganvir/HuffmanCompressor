Introduction

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies in the input data. More frequently occurring characters are assigned shorter codes, which results in efficient compression without any loss of information. This web application provides an interface to compress and decompress text files using Huffman coding.


Features

Text file compression using Huffman coding.
Decompression of Huffman-compressed files.
User-friendly interface for selecting and uploading files.
Real-time display of compression and decompression progress.
Downloading of compressed and decompressed files.


Usage

To use the Huffman compression web application, follow these steps:
Open the web application using the following link: https://sangdeepganvir.github.io/HuffmanCompressor/
Click on the Choose File button to select a text file for compression.
Once the file is selected, click on the Compress button.
The application will display the compression progress and provide a download link for the compressed file.
To decompress a file, click on the Choose File button in the decompression section.
Select the compressed file, and then click on the Decompress button.
The application will display the decompression progress and provide a download link for the decompressed file.


Demo

A live demo of the Huffman compression web application is available at: https://sangdeepganvir.github.io/HuffmanCompressor/


Installation

If you want to set up the web application locally, follow the steps below:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sangdeepganvir/HuffmanCompressor.git
